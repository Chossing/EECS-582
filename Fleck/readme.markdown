Fleck ![project-status](http://stillmaintained.com/statianzo/Fleck.png)
===

Fleck is a WebSocket server implementation in C#. Branched from the
[Nugget][nugget] project, Fleck requires no inheritance, container, or
additional references.

Example
---

The following is an example that will echo to a client.

```c#

var server = new WebSocketServer("ws://localhost:8181");
server.Start(socket =>
  {
    socket.OnOpen = () => Console.WriteLine("Open!");
    socket.OnClose = () => Console.WriteLine("Close!");
    socket.OnMessage = message => socket.Send(message);
  });
        
```

Supported WebSocket Versions
---

Fleck supports several WebSocket versions of modern web browsers

- Hixie-Draft-76/Hybi-00 (Safari 5, Chrome < 14, Firefox 4 (when enabled))
- Hybi-07 (Firefox 6)
- Hybi-10 (Chrome 14-16, Firefox 7)
- Hybi-13 (Chrome 17+)

Secure WebSockets (wss://)
---

Enabling secure connections requires two things: using the scheme `wss` instead
of `ws`, and pointing Fleck to an x509 certificate containing a public and
private key

```cs
var server = new WebSocketServer("wss://localhost:8431");
server.Certificate = "MyCert.cer";
server.Start(socket =>
  {
    //...use as normal
  });
```
